								<b>A digital divide</b> is an uneven distribution in the access to or usage of
								Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), such as computers, smartphones, and Internet.
								Often, these digital divides reflect broader divides between socioeconomic, age, and racial/ethnic groups,
								and deepen existing inequities. <a href="https://time.com/4718032/the-digital-divide/">In the US</a>,
								inequalities in computer and internet access are driven by the high cost of broadband and by geography.

							<p style="color:#696969">
								<b>As the world increasingly moves online,</b> digital divides become economic divides. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/business/economy/coronavirus-inequality.html">COVID19 lockdowns across the US</a>  have highlighted how inequalities in broadband access translate into inequalities in educational advancement, employment opportunities, and even healthcare access.

						<p style="color:#696969">	<!-- Yijing's insights here -->
							Overall, digital gap across different income levels, ages, and races appear to become narrower from 2010 to 2017, indicating a decreasing trend in digital inequlity across these demographic groups. Fewer people are not able to go online for structural reasons that are out of their control, and more people choose not to go online at home for subjective reasons (e.g. "not interested"). However, <b>digital divides still persist</b>, as a lower pecentage of those in the lowest income groups, older adults, and communities of color tend to have Internet access at home.

						<h3>2. Recent geographic and regional trends</h3>
						Within the U.S., the <a href=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/31/digital-gap-between-rural-and-nonrural-america-persists/>"urban-rural" digital divide </a> has been studied by several researchers and thinktanks. Below, we provide a visualization to examine % of U.S. Households with Computer Access for certain years (2015-2017).

					<p style="color:#696969"> <!-- Irena's insights here -->
					</br>Southern states tend to report computer usage that falls below the national average, while western states tend to report computer usage above the national average. Even though we see <b>clear regional divides</b>, many states that have less computer access compared to the national average - like NC and SC - do appear to be closing this gap over time. This is in line with <a href=https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/05/31/digital-gap-between-rural-and-nonrural-america-persists/> an article published by Pew Research Center</a> that notes "gap between rural and urban adults has narrowed for some devices like traditional and tablet computers, but rural adults still remain less likely than suburban adults to own these technologies". 
					 </p>
					 Future work on regional trends could look at within-state geographic patterns of computer access. For example, the Washington Post published an article last year suggesting that the digital divide within cities may be driven by <a href=https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/09/13/cities-not-rural-areas-are-real-internet-deserts/>refusal to use broadband and internet services </a>, rather than lack of infrastructure.

						<h3>3. Municipal broadband: a growing solution? </h3>

					<p style="color:#696969"> <!-- Megan's insights here -->
					 Private internet providers have monopolies over their respective regions in the US, allowing them to drive up
					 prices. Municipal broadband (MB), or the provision of broadband by a public provider, has been proposed as one way
					 to help areas with scarcer internet access bridge the divide. Seen above, the number of US residents with access to
						 fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) municipal broadband (in <span style="color:Blue">blue</span>) has steadily increased
						over the past two decades.
					</p>
					<p style="color:#696969">However, in the context of the entire US population (in <span style="color:Purple">purple</span>), FTTH municipal broadband
						still only <b>reaches less than 1% of Americans</b>.

						<div id="mb_vis2"></div>
					</header>
				 	<p style="color:#696969">
					Municipal broadband networks are a start in the process of bridging digital divides in the United States. More widespread access to ICT can only be achieved through treating
						Internet like electricity usage - as a public utility. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/technology/coronavirus-digital-divide.html">
						Some advocate for the federal government to step in</a> to provide subsidies to local governments and nonprofits
						to build fast and affordable networks across the US, increasing access not only to Internet but also to equal educational and
						economic opportunities for all Americans.
